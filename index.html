				My name is Vu Vuong, an aspiring web developer. I have a bacherlor's degree in geography with a focus on Geographic Information Systems. During my studies, I came into contact with programming web maps. After that class, I found myself interested in the processes behind the web that I spend much of my free time on. Having spent some time in limbo looking for a job, I felt I wanted to make most of my time, so instead of considering long term study, I felt a concentrated learning effort would suit me more, and thus I enrolled in Coding Boot Camp.

				My hobbies include watching anime, playing video games and reading web novels. It lets me exercise my imagination in crafter fantasy worlds. I hope a career in programming will let me bring my imagination into work.
